            <div>Over the past summer I decided I was going to learn how to become a website designer so I could build Wash U's Men's Club Ultimate Team a new website. For the most part I was self taught, but I did have some helpful pointers from a few friends.Admittedly it is still a work in progress, but click the picture to see what I've come up with so far.

            <div>This Fall semester I am enrolled in Wash U's Website Development course. The course covers coding in html, css, java script, as well as the implementation of twitter bootstrap and other helpful tools. For our first major project I designed a mock website for Baileys Range, a restuarant based in St. Louis. Click the picture to check out my website!

I am learning very fast through Wash U's Web Dev course as well as some reasearch and trial and error put in on my own time. Web design is a skill I will continue to nurture and I will continue to help others by designing websites for individuals and organizations, given the oportunity. Fill out a contact form if you have a project idea to share with me.

My overall experience as a camp counselor has given me a unique opportunity to develop skills such as leadership, planning, organization, responsibility, risk management, parenting, and many more. The requisite maturity and inherent responsibility involved in caring for other peoples' children 24/7 is something few other jobs require. As a result of this experience I know I will be one of the most diligent, organized, and aware candidates for any job I am qualified for. <hr>
